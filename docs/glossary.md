# Farmer Glossary

## **seed**
A seed is a completely working instance of a project that its images and built artifacts (e.g. node_modules, vendor, etc) are being used to create a plant for a customer.

Any project release (e.g. foorbar-1.x) should have a single seed so that deployments will be released on its related plants. (All customers will get the latest changes)

## **plant**
For every customer you are going to have a plant which is based on a seed and does have a unqiue hostname (e.g. walmart :D ).
